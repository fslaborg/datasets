Original Description:
======

Microarray compendia compiled by Diogo Camacho and others at the Jim Collins group for the DREAM5 network inference challenge.

Data were exported from original Matlab files by Daniel Marbach.

These are the original files before preparation for the challenge. (Subsequently, datasets were anonymized, including addition of some genes with random expression data. The official datasets of the challenge are provided as supplement of the paper)
